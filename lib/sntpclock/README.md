# esp8266-SNTPClock

Clock - Library for esp8266
	with SNTP support This project needs the Arduino environment for the
 ESP8266 chip:
 https:			//github.com/esp8266/Arduino.git

 It provides an instance of a clock, which is derived from the Ticker library see:
 http:				//arduino.esp8266.com/stable/doc/reference.html#ticker

 The clock has an API with following functions:

 -`begin() ` set params and retrieve time with:timeServerName, timezone, daylight
		    - `getTimeSeconds() ` get time in seconds
		    - `getTimeStruct() ` get a time structur(see Time.h)
 - `getTimeStr() ` get a string with current time ``` 13: 50: 59 ``` -`getDateTimeStr() ` get a string with date and time ``` 2015 - 10 - 28 13: 50: 59 ``` -`getSecond() ` get the current time seconds - `attachCb() ` attach a callback function with a timestamp, when to callback - `detachCb() ` detach the callback function This libraray uses time functions from the esp8266 SDK.Therefore, no separate NTP network calls are required.The library is based on the work of https:	//github.com/esp8266/Arduino.git
